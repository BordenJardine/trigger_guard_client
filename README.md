trigger guard
====================

Some day this will be a chrome extension for trigger warnings.

The plan is to have system where you can list the sort of content that is triggering for you, and if your browser starts navigating to a page containing said content, you will get a warning popup. The content will be tagged by the community.

This repo is the client portion, which is pretty close to being function.
